# Visions

Visions is a modding platform for The Coffin of Andy and Leyley, split into 2 parts:

- [Visions Database](https://github.com/visions-database/visions/tree/main/database) - a database of TCoAaL mods

- [Visions CLI](https://github.com/visions-database/visions/tree/main/cli) - a package manager for Visions Database

This organisation exists to organise Visions and TCoAaL mods in its database (that are on Github) in one place.
